1) Reimage plots for CNN

Refractor plot.py to plot_image.py to replot images. Needs to take single csv(original data) files and plot to images. Prior methodology needed 1 original data csv file, in a folder by itself, in order to create images to the specific folder. Each folder had user data. 

Now I should 
   - read all csv files
   - use file name to create images
   - send image/s to specific user/images folder with filename = user_image#.png
   - convert all images to jpg (may need another script to do this. used linux bash script before)

2) Add features to things FVs?

Add features to FV's, normalize, then re-classify with classification.r
 
3) LSTM & RNN

Look for usable RNN and LSTM in R/TensorFlow/sklearn

4) Write M.S. Defense paper.

Write M.S. Defense paper. Defense will be March 20 - March 25 (2017).
